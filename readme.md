# Balloon Game

**PLAY THE GAME in your browser**!

The Ballon Game is an arcade game that 
[*desperately needs a concise description*],
and [*still really needs a better name*].

# Development Checklist

Development stuff that needs to be done.

## Initial

- [x] Player
- [x] Balloon
- [x] Simple Jump Mechanics
- [x] Automatically Grab Balloons
- [x] Spawn New Balloons
- [x] Score
- [x] Scrolling Background
- [ ] ballons rise after you grab them
- [ ] It's fully playable and resembles the prototype

## Mobile

- [ ] mechanics for touch controls (jump + move)
- [ ] Android build works
- [ ] iOS build works 
- [ ] webGL touch controls

## Graphics

- [ ] background parallax scrolling
- [ ] player animations
- [ ] balloon animation
- [ ] balloon string animation
- [ ] grabbing balloons looks nice



# Development That Still Needs Planning


## Sound Effects

Find some good software for doing sound effects!

- [ ] pop sound
- [ ] jump sound 
- [ ] grab balloon sound
- [ ] ambient noises


## Music 

Find some good software for doing music!  It might be difficult than the
sound effects, although I'm going to assume there is a lot of overlap at 
this point. 

Make an awesome customized music selection for this game!
Feature a full album's worth of music.
The music should be good enough that you could listen to it without playing
the game at all, and it would still be enjoyable.

- [ ] start designing music playlist!
- [ ] Each song is enjoyable to listen to without the game.


## Additional Mechanics and Gameplay

Write a new gameplay outline! Things that are needed:

-       normal & difficult modes.  It's annoying if you are already good at the 
        game to play at the easiest difficulty.  The beginning becomes tedious.
        Ideally, a really good progression system should take of this,
        but if it can't... 
        then having difficulty modes would be better than nothing.

-       design a more in-depth progression.  Variables that govern balloon
        spawns, lifetimes, are good candidates for progression.


Random Ideas:

- [ ] ballon string = swinging rope
- [ ] patches of wind
- [ ] random obstacles spawn
- [ ] stuff flys out of the air and hits you
